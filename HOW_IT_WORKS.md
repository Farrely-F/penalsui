# PenalSUI - The Fun Soccer Game on the Blockchain! ⚽

## What is PenalSUI?

Imagine you're playing a penalty shootout game with your friend, but instead of using a real soccer ball, you're playing on a computer! PenalSUI is like a digital soccer game where two players take turns being the shooter (trying to score goals) and the goalkeeper (trying to stop goals).

The cool thing is that this game lives on something called a "blockchain" - think of it like a magical notebook that everyone can see, but no one can cheat or change the rules!

## How to Play (Super Simple!)

### Step 1: Create a Game 🎮

- One player says "Hey, let's play soccer!"
- They create a new game and wait for a friend to join
- It's like setting up a soccer field and waiting for your buddy!

### Step 2: Join the Game 👥

- Another player sees the game and says "I want to play too!"
- They join the game, and now we have two players ready to play

### Step 3: Start Playing! 🚀

- Either player can say "Let's start!"
- The game begins with 5 rounds of penalty shots

### Step 4: Take Turns ⚡

- **Round 1**: Player 1 shoots, Player 2 tries to save
- **Round 2**: Player 2 shoots, Player 1 tries to save
- **Round 3**: Player 1 shoots, Player 2 tries to save
- **Round 4**: Player 2 shoots, Player 1 tries to save
- **Round 5**: Player 1 shoots, Player 2 tries to save

### Step 5: How to Score Goals 🥅

- The shooter picks a direction: Left, Center, or Right
- The goalkeeper also picks a direction: Left, Center, or Right
- **If they pick DIFFERENT directions = GOAL!** ⚽
- **If they pick the SAME direction = SAVE!** 🧤

### Step 6: Who Wins? 🏆

- After 5 rounds, count up all the goals
- The player with more goals wins!
- If both players have the same number of goals, it's a tie!

## The Magic Rules (How the Computer Keeps Track)

The computer remembers:

- What round are we on? (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)

### Round Information 🔄

For each round, the computer remembers:
